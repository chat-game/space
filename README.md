# [Client] Online game Royal Madness 👑

👉 Check latest build: https://hmbanan666.github.io/royal-madness-client/

🤔 Imagine an open world where your Hero can:
- 🗺️ **Travel**, **defeat** creatures and **find** an infinite number of quests
- 💎 **Gather** loot and a variety of materials
- 🏗️ **Construct** buildings with other Heroes
- 💬 **Chat** with other Heroes in real time
- 🐕 **Collect** battle pets, **upgrade** them, and **fight** Bosses in turn-based battles
- 🏆 **Earn** more than 1000 achievements!

Let's build a similar world together!

## What will be here?
- [Front] Web client for the game made with **Typescript**, **React**, and **Redux**
  - simple graphics, top view camera
  - movements with mouse clicks (or finger taps)
  - some interface, menu, inventory slots...
- [Back] Server on **Node.js**, where will be a storage for progress of all Heroes

## Why?
- I want to take a break from product development and develop some game that myself would play in the evenings.
- It will be made using front and back parts, with good code practices (hope so 😀). 
- Want to discover something new in software development. Some new challenges and their overcoming!
- I enjoy the new achievements on GitHub, especially Starstruck x4: "Created a repository that has 4096 stars". Why not to try?
